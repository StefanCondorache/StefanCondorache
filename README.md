Currently, I'm working on projects to improve my skills and understanding of building scalable systems. My goal is to build practical knowledge through real-world projects and challenges. Feel free to explore my repositories to see how I'm progressing!

## Projects
- TicTacToe — Classic game in Java.  
  https://github.com/StefanCondorache/TicTacToe
- AI_Chess — Chess engine / AI experiments (Python).  
  https://github.com/StefanCondorache/AI_Chess
- Universitate — University assignments and exercises (Java, C++, Python, MATLAB).  
  https://github.com/StefanCondorache/Universitate
- Converter-num--rom — Number conversion utilities (JS, Python).  
  https://github.com/StefanCondorache/Converter-num--rom
- ROCK-the-SHOP — Store management system (C++).  
  https://github.com/StefanCondorache/ROCK-the-SHOP
- Pitank — Python project.  
  https://github.com/StefanCondorache/Pitank
- Company-Classifier — Company data classifier (Python).  
  https://github.com/StefanCondorache/Company-Classifier

## Working with:
- Programming fundamentals & OOP (Java, C++): clear use of classes, structure and design for games and small systems.  
- Algorithms & problem solving: coursework and game projects show practice with algorithmic thinking.  
- Game logic & AI (Python): experience with search, heuristics and game-state handling (AI_Chess, TicTacToe).  
- Machine learning & data work (Python): data preprocessing, model training and evaluation (Company-Classifier, experiments).  
- Systems & small application design: simple backend/file or DB-backed apps and utilities (ROCK-the-SHOP, converters).  
- Databases & storage: basic MySQL and MongoDB usage for persistence.  
- Scripting & automation: quick tools and utilities in Python and JavaScript.  
- Practical debugging & iterative development: many small projects and assignments indicate hands-on testing and fixes.

Growth happens at the edge of discomfort. Limits are illusions—what others call impossible is just a challenge to conquer. I thrive on solving mathematical problems and LeetCode challenges, knowing that with relentless effort and discipline, nothing stands in the way of achieving greatness.
